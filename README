To run the program, enter ./Master -n <positive integer> -s <positive integer>.

The executible for child is called Worker. An alarm with 2 seconds is used to self
terminate the program. Alarm is still affected by the scheduler, so the more processes 
that are running, the slower the program is able to catch the alarm signal. The 
program also terminates from Ctrl-C user input.
